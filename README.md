# Pranav's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Pranav, specializing in data engineering and analytics. Below are some of the projects I've worked on:

## Data Engineering And Analytics Portfolio

### [Sentiment Analysis - Project 1](https://github.com/Pranavprasanthan/Final_Capstone.git)
#### Sentiment Analysis (Natural Language Processing)

- **Description**: This project analyzes sentiment in product reviews using natural language processing.
- **Technologies**: Python, NLP techniques.
- **Features**: Preprocessing, sentiment analysis, report generation.
- **Installation**: See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.
- **Usage**: Run `sentiment_analysis.py` with the provided dataset (`1429_1.csv`).

### [Data Engineering and Automation - Project 2](https://github.com/Pranavprasanthan/data-engg.git)
#### Data engineering and automation on imported data from an API using Python V3.7, Docker, and Pandas.

- **Description**: Automating data ingestion and transformation from an API using Python and Docker.
- **Technologies**: Python, Docker, PostgreSQL.
- **Features**: Data ingestion pipeline, ETL process, Dockerization.
- **Installation**: See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.

### [Data Profiling - Project 3](https://github.com/Pranavprasanthan/Data_profiling.git)
#### Data profiling and automation on imported data from the UK government website of different attributes concerning petroleum sectors.

1. **Data Retrieval**: Script checks for new data and downloads new Excel files if detected.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Remove unnecessary information.
   - Ensure a consistent and well-structured format.
   - Perform statistical analysis (min, max, median, mean).
   - Handle missing values and null data.
   - Visualize data using Matlab.
   - Standardize date and timestamp formats.
   - Retain processing information and original filenames.
3. **Data Export**: Save the resulting DataFrame to CSV format for easy ingestion into a data lake.

### [Data Visualization - Project 4](https://github.com/Pranavprasanthan/Market_share.git)
#### Job market share by various MNC's in India

This project uses an online database to analyze and visualize data regarding which key firms are thriving in India's data analytics industry and the market share of the Indian IT sector controlled by these organizations imported from "Kaggle."

Feel free to explore each project for more details and code implementation!
